$commits

Please write a daily work report summarizing what I accomplished today. The report should be:
- Written for sharing with superiors and colleagues in a team chat
- Organized by project/repo
- Use plenty of emojis to make it lively and fun to read
- Keep it concise but informative
- Use bullet points
- Start with a greeting and end with a sign-off
- Don't include commit hashes, just summarize the work done
- IMPORTANT: Group related commits into a single high-level accomplishment. If multiple commits are clearly part of the same feature or task (e.g. building it, then refactoring/moving it, then fixing it), describe the end result as one bullet point, not each step separately. Focus on what was delivered, not the journey to get there."
